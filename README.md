## Task 1: Website Wireframe

Include screenshots of your website wireframe here. Make sure the wireframe is clear and easy to understand/read. To compliment your wireframes, describe the layout and how the elements are organized. Screenshots that are blurry or hard to read will be penalized. 

In addition to the screenshots, you can also a link to your wireframe file (if you used an online tool to create it). Make sure the link is accessible to the teaching team (check using an incognito window). This is not a replacement for the screenshots, but an additional resource for the teaching team to understand your wireframe.

The website as seen is pretty straight forward. There is on all pages a section on the top to help the user to navigate the site between the different tabs. All hyperlinks are also underlined, making it easier for the user to identify them as well. There is not much responsive design so most of it is simply text for the user to read through to learn more about me as a person.
